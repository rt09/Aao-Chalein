    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p style="text-decoration: solid">
      “Aao Chalein” is a budding entrepreneurial venture aspiring for
      groundbreaking innovations in transport and commute. We strive for
      bringing in convenience and safety to the travelers along with an
      addressal to making the journeys more economical and relatable. Besides,
      we are also working upon initiatives to help people sharing common
      backgrounds and interests to connect with each other for real.

    <h3>Sa-Haive</h3>
    <p style="text-decoration: solid">
      “Sa-Haive” is web based application which pairs up individuals from the
      same Institution based upon their common destination and agreeable time
      interval. The platform has been built keeping in mind the remote
      institutions with a significant number of commuters but it can be a good
      fit for remote localities as well. The application shall also provide the
      travelers with contact details of verified drivers for that area. It can
      also help the students plan any trip to/from the institution in advance by
      looking up at the database to identify the co-travellers. The application
      thus comes with a commitment to cut down an individual's traveling
      expenditures and bring in a sense of safety to the travelers. 
      <br>
    <p>
      The project was born out of inconveniences we faced at our own Campus, IIT
      Kanpur. With more than 9K+ individuals onboard at this remote location and
      multiple commuters round the clock, the institution is a good fit for the
      problem as well as the solution we have come up with. The portal is
      currently going through the testing phase at our Campus and we shall be
      working upon further improvements and advances with the course of time.
    </p>
    <h4>Your convenience, our command, hassle free features:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Institute ID authentication for login</li>
      <li>User agreed time interval being used for pairing</li>
      <li>Public visibility of user details as per their consent</li>
      <li>Removal of chaotic individuals from the portal</li>
      <li>Contact with reliable and verified local drivers</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
      <h3>Route Anomaly Alert: </h3>
  
      <p>
      With this feature added, the website “Sa-Haive” shall alert
      the user in case the driver is taking an unusual route to the destination.
      In remote areas with sparse populations, this is one of the major safety
      concerns for most of us. In case an unfavorable situation builds up, the
      user can alert the local police authorities through this portal of a
      possible life risk.
      <br> 
      <br>
      <br>
      </p>
      <h3>Kon-act: </h3> 
      <p>
      At Institutions as large as our own, there is
      a plethora of individuals working upon pretty much all the domains known
      to humanity. However, what we found somewhat missing was a platform to
      connect the willing peers together who could then together work in unison.
      At IITK, we are still fortunate enough to have clubs, societies and
      interest groups which is however not the case at a majority of
      institutions. Moreover, such connections cross-cutting through the
      physical boundaries of their respective institutions is extremely rare.
      “Kon-act” is a project we have been working upon keeping this issue in
      mind, aiming to unite all the interest groups who could be a help to each
      other, together.
